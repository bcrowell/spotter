=head2 Throttle.pm

This module handles two somewhat related tasks: (1) Protect against a denial of service attack, or patterns of
use that have the same effect as one. (2) Keep track of how frequently a particular student has been checking
answers, and don't let them do arbitrarily many guesses in an arbitrarily short time.

=head3 shut_out_evil_ip()

Fighting against DOS attacks, spambots, etc.:

The file dos_log contains the following:
   ip address of most recent user
   list of all the times that that user has used Spotter
The file blocked_<date> contains a list of ip addresses that are blocked for the day.
If being attacked systematically, can set apache's httpd.conf file to deny access to
an ip address or a range of ip addresses; see http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.0/howto/auth.html .
Basically you put something like "Deny from 85.91" at the end of the 'Directory "/usr/local/www/cgi-bin"' section.
The apache mechanism is effective against a range of IP addresses, whereas the stuff built into Spotter
below only works against an attack from a single address.

In cases where it's appropriate, this routine silently calls exit().
