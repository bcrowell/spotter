  <!-- The <find> tag lists a quantity that the student is supposed to find.
  
       The <var> tag specifies a variable that may appear in the solution, and
       gives a general range of numerical values that might make sense for that
       variable; this range is needed so that the software can pick random
       values for the variables to test whether the student's expression is
       equivalent to a particular right or wrong answer.
             
       For a correct answer, use an empty ans tag, <ans exp="..."/> ( or an
       <ans> tag containing only other tags, with no text).  It's not
       necessary to specify multiple answers when the answers are numerically
       equal to each other. For instance, <ans exp="a+b"/> will match an input
       of "b+a" from the student. In the rare cases where there is more than one
       correct answer, and they are not numerically equal, you can give more than
       one correct answer.
       Incorrect answers don't need to be specified explicitly, since there is
       an infinite number of possibilities. However, if you know a certain incorrect
       answer is common, then you can provide feedback to students who give that
       answer by using an <ans> tag with text inside.
              
       If the <var> and <ans> tags are nested
       inside a <find> tag, then they apply only within its scope. Otherwise
       they apply to the whole problem.
       
       The <ans> tags can only refer to variables that have already
       been declared.

 <!--  By default in symbolic problems, the software will tell
       the student if her answer is a constant multiple of the correct
       answer, or is equal to the correct answer plus a constant. These
       defualts can be modified with the timesconstant and plusconstant
       rules. As a special case, the software checks at runtime
       for answers that are pure constants, e.g. "2/7" or "4pi"; such
       an answer will not be matched by the timesconstant and plusconstant
       options (even if they were explictly set to "yes" in the <problem>).
       
       By default in numerical problems, and answer that equals the correct
       result except for a power of 10 is flagged as a conversion mistake.
       This can be overridden with conversionmistake="no".
       expressions="yes" - allows arithmetic expressions to be used in answers to numerical problems
       units="yes" - allows the student to supply units by typing them in, e.g. "1 kg" or
       		"1000 g" are both ok
       unitlist - gives a comma-separated list of possible units;
            the student is supplied with a pop-up
       		menu of units, and must choose one; her input is multiplied by this unit;
