          Solve the equation cx-7cb-a=0 for x in terms of the other variables.
           (See the bottom of the
          page for information on how to enter your expression.)
          Suggestions: Try rearranging the terms of your result in two different
          ways, and see what happens. Try intentionally entering an incorrect answer,
          or an answer that has variables in it that aren't even part of the problem.
           <var sym="a">a variable</var>
           <var sym="b">another variable</var>
           <var sym="c">yet another variable</var>

          A square has sides of length s. What is its area? (See the bottom of the
          page for information on how to enter your expression.)
          Suggestion: Try putting in an answer that doesn't even come out to
          have the right units for an area. Also, try writing your expression 
          incorrectly, without the ^ symbol, to see how the software responds.
           <var sym="s" units="m">the length of the sides</var>
