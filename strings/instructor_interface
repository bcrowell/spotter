--Some of the following is based on what the CGI::Application::Plugin::Authentication does:
--"If you plan to create your own login page, I would recommend that you start with the HTML code for the default login
--page, so that your login page will contain the correct form fields and hidden fields."
-- The hidden form fields are:
--  destination (the url we're going to)
--  some more that don't seem to matter
-- The other fields it wants are:
--   authen_password (changed from my password)
--   authen_username (changed from my username)

password_form = <<__html__
<form method="POST" action="$url">
  <input type="hidden" name="authen_username" value="$username">
  <input type="hidden" name="destination" value="$url" />
  Password:
    <input type="password" name="authen_password" size="20" maxlength="20"><br>
  <input type="submit" value="Log in.">
</form>
