            Too many answers have been entered in a short time period on this computer and/or this account.
             To discourage random guessing, longer and longer wait times are required if you
             keep on entering answers over and over.
             If you're having trouble doing this problem, maybe you should get help from your instructor!
             You have entered more than $number answers within 
             $interval seconds.
             This waiting period will expire in $expire seconds.

    <h3>How to enter answers into Spotter</h3>
    <h4>Numerical answers</h4>
    <p>Enter the number. If there is a pop-up menu of units, select the
    units in which your answer is expressed. Never
    type in units; either select them from the menu or don't supply them at all.
    Enter scientific
    notation like this: <tt>3.0 10^8</tt> means 3.0x10<sup>8</sup>. 
    </p>
    <h4>Symbolic answers</h4>
    <p>Examples:
    <ul>
        <table border="1" width="600">
          <tr><td>ab (a multiplied by b)</td><td><tt>ab</tt></td></tr>
          <tr><td> x<sup>2</sup> (x squared)    </td><td><tt> <tt>x^2</tt>  </tt></td></tr>
          <tr><td> x<sub>2</sub> (name contains a subscript)    </td><td><tt> <tt>x2</tt>  </tt></td></tr>
          <tr><td> square root of 2   </td><td><tt> sqrt(2)  </tt></td></tr>
          <tr><td> sin x   </td><td><tt>  sin x </tt></td></tr>
          <tr><td> sin<sup>-1</sup> x   </td><td><tt> asin x  </tt></td></tr>
          <tr><td> sin<sup>2</sup>x   </td><td><tt> (sin x)^2  </tt></td></tr>
          <tr><td> sin 2x   </td><td><tt> sin(2x) (parentheses required)  </tt></td></tr>
          <tr><td> <sup>a</sup>/<sub>bc</sub>   </td><td><tt> a/(bc) (parentheses required)  </tt></td></tr>
          <tr><td> &pi;   </td><td><tt> pi (not 3.14) </tt></td></tr>
          <tr><td> e<sup>x</sup>   </td><td><tt> e^x </tt></td></tr>
<!--          <tr><td> <math  xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><mfrac><mrow><mi>a</mi><mo>+</mo><mi>b</mi></mrow><mrow><mi>c</mi><mo>+</mo><mi>d</mi></mrow></mfrac></math>   </td><td><tt> e^x </tt></td></tr> -->
          <tr><td>
           <table><tr><td>a+b</td></tr><tr><td><pre>---</pre></td></tr></tr><td>c+d</td></tr></table> 
          </td><td><tt> (a+b)/(c+d) (parentheses required) </tt></td></tr>
          <tr><td> sin <sup>a</sup>/<sub>bc</sub>   </td><td><tt> sin[a/(bc)]<br/> (using (), [], and {} makes it easier<br/>for you to see what you're doing)  </tt></td></tr>

    <p>
    Spotter only checks whether your answer is <i>numerically</i> equal to the answer the
    instructor put in previously. It doesn't check whether it is in the right
    <i>form</i>. It doesn't know whether a symbolic answer has been simplified
    as much as possible, and it doesn't know whether a numerical answer has the
    right number of significant figures. It's your responsibility to check these things;
    don't try to blame it on the software if you get them wrong!
