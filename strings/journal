<p>If you scroll down, first you'll see your current version of your text with all the formatting, and then below that you'll 
see a window in which you can edit your text. To make a paragraph break, put in a blank line between the paragraphs. 
To make a section heading, put the heading on a line by itself, with an equals sign, =, at the beginning of the line. 
Subsection headings are made with a ==, and subsubsections with a ===. 
To make a table of data, put a * at the beginning of each line.</p>
<p>Your changes will not be saved until you click on the Save button! To avoid losing changes by mistake, you should make 
a habit of saving your text very often as you work on it.</p>
