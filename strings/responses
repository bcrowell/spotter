The numerical part of your answer, $raw_input, has either too many or too few significant figures.
As a rule of thumb, the precision of the result of a calculation is limited by the precision of the least accurate piece of data used to calculate it.
A common mistake is to believe in the fallacy of false precision suggested by your calculator's willingness to display a result with many digits.
when you communicate such a result to someone else, you are misleading them (and possibly also deluding yourself).
The precision of a result can also be limited by all the simplifying assumptions that went into translating a real-world situation into
equations; for example, even if I know that a rock is being dropped from a height of 1.000000 m in a gravitational field of 9.82237 m/s<sup>2</sup>,
I can't calculate the time it takes to hit the ground to 6 sig figs, because at that level of precision, air resistance would be an important factor.

units_lecture=<<__lecture__
Your answer has the wrong units, so either you made a mistake in your algebra or you entered your answer incorrectly.
A typical mistake would be to enter a+b/c+d when you really meant (a+b)/(c+d).
